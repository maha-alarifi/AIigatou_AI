In this project I'll explaine our pipeline from the preprocessing of our datasets, training CycleGAN model, till we finaly upscaled the output and discared the noise.

## Datasets Preprocessing
In the cycleGAN archetucture, there are two GAN models. Each GAN model need to be trained on distinguished dataset inorder to come with something new. Since my team and I want to work with our own dataset, we came up with a way to have differnet representation of our dataset.
